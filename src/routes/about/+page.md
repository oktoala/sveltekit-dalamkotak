Yo what up everyone. ðŸ‘‹

## Why made Dalamkotak?

Dalamkotak was just a project for me to learn web development. Dalamkotak was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
You can see it on [hugo.dalamkotak.com](https://hugo.dalamkotak.com)

Right now, It was made using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

## What is Dalamkotak mean?

First of all, I don't really like to branding something with my name. So I decided to find another name.

At that time, I thought "What name that so **Out Of The Box**?"

"Ohh, It's **In Of The Box**"

And here we are.

I also inspired from [Spongebob episode](https://youtu.be/qrnUXu_BIgI) where Spongebob and Patrick do kind of stuff **inside the box**.

## How Dalamkotak now?

Right now, **Dalamkotak** is just a portofolio website to store all of my project in one domain.

Maybe I'll write some blog post in the future. We'll see.

I think that's it from me, Smell ya later. ðŸ‘‹
