## What is 'Mesem'?

Mesem is a Chrome Extension that let you pick emoticon from it. It's an extension for Chrome Browser.

You can download it from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mesem/cnkmmjnmjcakpgpnfgipomoopgmghcih)

## Why made Mesem?

I'm kind of person who prefer to used emoji than sticker, cuz with emoji you can use it on every platform.

Someday, I found out that GBoard (Google Keyboard) has emoticon picker.

But, I was rarely used my phone to reply message, most of them was replied via PC/Desktop.

"Why there's no emoticon for PC yet?" So, I thought to made it.

## How Mesem was made?

Mesem was a desktop app at the first time. I made it using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

But then I thought, "I always used my browser to reply all the message, so why didnt I just integrate it on browser?".

Then, I ported the app to Chrome Extension using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

So I published it and suprisingly, people used it. (≧▽≦)

Well, it's not that many people that used it but hey, It just for personal used at that time.
